# Enterprise Hub MCP Skill

The official runbook for employee-owned agents to install and use the Enterprise Hub remote MCP
launcher. It uses browser login and the official service origin
`https://api.smedatacenter.xyz`; employees never give passwords, tokens, or authorization codes to
an agent.

This repository contains only skill and client-connection guidance. It never operates the
Enterprise Hub API, database, Qdrant, storage, Docker, worker, cloud resources, or deployment.
Those service responsibilities remain in
[SME_DATA_CENTER](https://github.com/YinXiaoyu-1998/SME_DATA_CENTER).

> Live-service status: `enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher@0.4.0`, browser login, and the public HTTPS MCP
> boundary are deployed together and independently verified. Real employee login and backend
> authorization are still required.

## Install The Skill

Clone or download this repository, then install the skill to the canonical current-user skill
directory. Do not default to `~/.codex/skills`.

| Platform         | Canonical target                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS/Linux-like | `~/.agents/skills/enterprise-hub-mcp`             |
| Windows          | `%USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\enterprise-hub-mcp` |

macOS/Linux-like shell:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills"
SKILL_TARGET="$HOME/.agents/skills/enterprise-hub-mcp"
if [ -e "$SKILL_TARGET" ]; then
  mv "$SKILL_TARGET" "$SKILL_TARGET.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"
fi
cp -R skills/enterprise-hub-mcp "$SKILL_TARGET"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$SkillRoot = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".agents\skills"
$SkillTarget = Join-Path $SkillRoot "enterprise-hub-mcp"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $SkillRoot | Out-Null
if (Test-Path $SkillTarget) {
  Move-Item $SkillTarget "$SkillTarget.bak.$(Get-Date -Format yyyyMMddHHmmss)"
}
Copy-Item -Recurse "skills\enterprise-hub-mcp" $SkillTarget
```

Restart Codex or open a new task after installation so the skill list refreshes.

## Update The Skill

Ask your agent: “Update the enterprise-hub-mcp-skill skill.” The installed skill recognizes both
`enterprise-hub-mcp` and `enterprise-hub-mcp-skill`, retrieves the latest default-branch revision
from [this official repository](https://github.com/YinXiaoyu-1998/enterprise-hub-mcp-skill), and
backs up, replaces, and verifies its complete skill directory. A marketplace listing is not
required. The agent reports the source commit and installation path; reload the host if needed.

For an older copy without update instructions, bootstrap once with: “Update my installed
enterprise-hub-mcp skill from https://github.com/YinXiaoyu-1998/enterprise-hub-mcp-skill,
using the complete skills/enterprise-hub-mcp directory on its latest default branch.”

Updating the skill alone preserves the launcher and login session. A launcher upgrade uses a
separate user request and the exact pin in the refreshed official skill. Network/write access
and the host's supported installation mechanism are still required. See the
[update procedure](skills/enterprise-hub-mcp/references/update-skill.md).

## Official Launcher

The only approved launcher package is `enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher@0.4.0`. Never use npm
`latest`, an unpinned version, or launcher self-update.

Run `node --version` and `npm --version` first. Node.js **22 or newer** and a working npm are
required. If Node.js is absent or its major version is below 22, install/upgrade it for the current
user before installing the launcher.

| Platform | Current-user package directory                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/Enterprise Hub/launcher/versions/0.4.0/` |
| Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Enterprise Hub\\launcher\\versions\\0.4.0\\`           |

An authorized employee-owned agent installs or repairs it idempotently:

```sh
npm install --prefix "<launcher-directory>" --save-exact enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher@0.4.0
```

The agent must run the exact platform self-check before claiming success:

```sh
ENTERPRISE_HUB_BASE_URL=https://api.smedatacenter.xyz \
  "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Enterprise Hub/launcher/versions/0.4.0/node_modules/.bin/enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher" self-check
```

```powershell
$env:ENTERPRISE_HUB_BASE_URL = "https://api.smedatacenter.xyz"
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Enterprise Hub\launcher\versions\0.4.0\node_modules\.bin\enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher.cmd" self-check
```

Self-check returns only safe machine-readable fields:
`ok`, `launcherVersion`, `serviceOrigin`, `platform`,
`secureStore.{available,durableCredentialPresent}`,
`server.{reachable,metadataCompatible,minimumLauncherVersion,recommendedLauncherVersion,recommendedUpdateAvailable}`,
and `mcp.handshake` (`ok`, `not_authenticated`, or `unavailable`). The launcher never self-updates.
An approved update uses a new exact versioned directory, changes only the invoking agent's MCP
launcher path, and preserves the operating-system secure session.

## Configuration And Login

Configure Enterprise Hub as a **local stdio launcher**, not as a direct remote HTTP/OAuth server.
The launcher connects to `https://api.smedatacenter.xyz`, opens the system browser for login, and
keeps its durable credential only in macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager. Configuration,
environment variables, command arguments, files, logs, and chat must never contain passwords,
tokens, authorization codes, raw headers, or OAuth secrets.

The complete stdio launch tuple is fixed. It has one `serve` argument and one non-secret
environment value—do not add a working directory, another environment variable, or a credential.

| Platform | Command                                                                                                              | Args    | Env                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/Enterprise Hub/launcher/versions/0.4.0/node_modules/.bin/enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher` | `serve` | `ENTERPRISE_HUB_BASE_URL=https://api.smedatacenter.xyz` |
| Windows  | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Enterprise Hub\\launcher\\versions\\0.4.0\\node_modules\\.bin\\enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher.cmd`     | `serve` | `ENTERPRISE_HUB_BASE_URL=https://api.smedatacenter.xyz` |

Before changing an MCP client, inspect its configuration and make a timestamped backup. Add or
replace only its `enterprise-hub` stdio entry; preserve every unrelated server and setting.

- Codex: use the verified `codex mcp list|get|add|remove` CLI. On macOS, resolve `codex` from PATH
  or use `/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/codex`; on Windows, resolve `codex.exe`.
  Back up `~/.codex/config.toml` or `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` before mutation. Add the
  stdio entry with `codex mcp add --env ENTERPRISE_HUB_BASE_URL=https://api.smedatacenter.xyz enterprise-hub -- <platform-launcher-path> serve`.
  Verify with `codex mcp get enterprise-hub --json` and self-check. Repair by removing only a
  mismatched `enterprise-hub` entry and re-adding it; per-agent removal uses
  `codex mcp remove enterprise-hub`, followed by `codex mcp list --json` and an absent `get`.
- OpenClaw: use `openclaw mcp add` for a new stdio entry or `openclaw mcp set` for the smallest
  idempotent replacement, then prove it with `openclaw mcp doctor enterprise-hub --probe`. The
  macOS add form is `openclaw mcp add enterprise-hub --command "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Enterprise Hub/launcher/versions/0.4.0/node_modules/.bin/enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher" --arg serve --env ENTERPRISE_HUB_BASE_URL=https://api.smedatacenter.xyz`.
  Do not use `openclaw mcp login` or `openclaw mcp logout`: those manage OpenClaw's direct HTTP
  OAuth store, while the Enterprise Hub launcher owns browser login and secure storage.
- Other agents: use guarded adaptive discovery—inspect product help and current config, back up,
  add only the pinned local stdio entry, and validate the handshake. Do not guess destructively or
  configure direct OAuth.

Use `enterprise_hub_auth_status` when authentication state is unknown. On
`authentication_required`, invoke `enterprise_hub_login` and ask the employee only to complete the
browser page. After success, retry the original business operation once. Use
`enterprise_hub_logout` only on an employee's request; it signs out all local Enterprise Hub
agents sharing that OS-user secure store.

When an employee asks which Enterprise Hub account is active, use the zero-input
`enterprise_hub_get_current_user` tool. It returns only the authenticated employee's
`displayName`, `email`, and `role`; it accepts no account selector and exposes no internal IDs,
labels, or credentials.

## Structured Dataset Guidance

Run `list_structured_datasets` before using a dataset and follow only the datasets, fields,
operators, and capabilities it advertises. Field `canonicalName` values are the only valid
structured-query field names; use `sourceColumn` and `aliases` only to map employee wording or
source-table labels to canonical fields and to present friendlier result headers.

Use `describe_structured_dataset_coverage` when the employee needs to know which readable applied
sources exist for a dataset before deciding whether a query is complete enough. Coverage returns
source facts only: window datasets report readable import windows, snapshot datasets report
readable snapshots, and datasets without query-scope metadata return no sources. The client, not
the service, decides and states any sufficiency assumptions.

`business` and `dishes` use the launcher 0.4.0 partition workflow. Give
`upload_structured_dataset` the original CSV/XLSX once with `file.encoding:"path"`, enterprise and
inclusive date metadata, and an idempotency key. The launcher streams files up to the service's
2 GiB source limit; agents must not split or rewrite them. Poll `get_partition_import_status` to
`published`. For analysis, inspect coverage and call `download_structured_partitions`; the launcher
returns verified local CSV paths without exposing presigned URLs, and the caller must remove that
exact scratch directory in `finally`. `query_structured_dataset` intentionally rejects these two
datasets.

Structured queries are controlled read-only JSON requests, never SQL. Detail queries return
selected canonical fields. Aggregate queries may use explicit mechanical aggregates only:
`count`, `countDistinct`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, and `weightedAvg`. Group by at most four
canonical fields and request at most twelve aggregates; aggregate sorting must use a group-by
field or an aggregate alias from the same request. `weightedAvg` requires numeric aggregatable
`field` and `weightField` values from the same dataset and returns `null` when total weight is zero
or missing.

For `delivery_ledger` and `supplier_catalog`, upload CSV/XLSX with `enterpriseName`,
`idempotencyKey`, and `labelKeys`; omit all date fields. A delivery file is one receipt, with
receipt ID/date derived from the source. A supplier file is one complete current snapshot, not a
delta or chunk. Poll `get_import_status` until `importBatch.status=applied` before querying.

The latest successful applied supplier snapshot is the only current enrichment source. Delivery
queries may select dynamic phone/address fields only when discovery advertises them, but cannot
filter, sort, group, or aggregate them unless discovery says otherwise; they may be `null` for no
visible current catalog, no exact match, blank data, or ambiguity. Do not fall back to an older
catalog.

Quarantine certificate uploads use `upload_quarantine_certificate`, one JPG/JPEG/PNG image per
call, linked by `receiptId`. Query certificates only with explicit `receiptIds`; use
`get_source_document_download_url` with a returned `sourceDocumentId` when the employee needs the
original file.

## Safe Use

- Backend authorization, not client filtering, determines visible organizations, labels, and
  resources. Do not provide organization IDs or infer hidden data.
- For questions about Enterprise Hub资料、SOP、uploaded files、company data, or recently uploaded
  tables, answer through Enterprise Hub MCP tools. Treat local files as upload inputs only unless
  the employee explicitly asks for local-file-only inspection.
- Prefer path-mode uploads so the launcher reads only the user-selected file's exact bytes. Never
  normalize or reconstruct content.
- For structured-table follow-ups such as “这份表” or “刚传的表”, scope the query to the upload's
  returned import metadata, business-date window, enterprise/store name, or other service-returned
  context. If that context is unavailable, ask a short clarification before querying all visible
  historical rows.
- Poll status without starting workers; do not operate service infrastructure.
- Reuse a structured-import idempotency key only for an exact replay. Treat import-status 404 as
  not visible or missing.
- Keep evidence cursors unchanged for the same query/filter/limit. Restart on `INVALID_CURSOR`;
  explain `CURSOR_EXPIRED` and restart only if the employee wants to continue.
- The Skill Directory lists metadata only—do not execute entries or generate reports/dashboards.

### Dish Catalog Snapshots

Use `dish_catalog` only after `list_structured_datasets` advertises it. Upload one complete
CSV/XLSX catalog snapshot with `snapshotDate: "YYYYMMDD"`; do not send `startDate`/`endDate`, split
or chunk the file, upload changed rows, or merge a partial catalog. If the snapshot is too large,
remove unrelated sheets/columns outside the catalog schema, use a service-supported larger limit,
or seek operator help.

Snapshots may be historical and out of order. A different same-date correction requires archiving
the existing snapshot through the authorized maintenance path first; a newer upload does not
replace older history. Query catalog data with the discovery-reported `snapshot_date` scope. Do not
infer latest/current state, diffs, or added/removed/discontinued status across snapshots.

## Lifecycle

For per-agent removal, back up that agent's configuration and remove only its `enterprise-hub`
entry. For shared logout, use `enterprise_hub_logout` or run the exact platform command:

```sh
ENTERPRISE_HUB_BASE_URL=https://api.smedatacenter.xyz \
  "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Enterprise Hub/launcher/versions/0.4.0/node_modules/.bin/enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher" logout
```

```powershell
$env:ENTERPRISE_HUB_BASE_URL = "https://api.smedatacenter.xyz"
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Enterprise Hub\launcher\versions\0.4.0\node_modules\.bin\enterprise-hub-mcp-launcher.cmd" logout
```

Logout returns only
`{"remoteRevocationConfirmed":<boolean>,"localCredentialRemoved":<boolean>}`, attempts remote
revocation when reachable, and always attempts local deletion. Do not report local logout success
unless `localCredentialRemoved` is true. For complete uninstall with explicit authorization, log
out, remove Enterprise Hub entries from safely discoverable local agents, and remove the
current-user launcher directory and non-secret state. Never remove Node.js/npm, other MCP servers,
the Employee Account, or server-side business data.
